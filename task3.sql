Got it üëç
Let‚Äôs finish this task step by step with SQL examples so you can clearly see how to use INSERT, NULL, DEFAULT, UPDATE, and DELETE.


---

1. INSERT INTO ‚Äì Adding Rows

Suppose we have a table:

CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    city VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Unknown'
);

üëâ Insert rows:

-- Insert all column values
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, age, city)
VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 21, 'Delhi');

-- Insert with missing value (NULL for city)
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, age, city)
VALUES (2, 'Anita', 22, NULL);

-- Insert with default value for city
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, age)
VALUES (3, 'Vikram', 20);


---

2. Handling Missing Values (NULL or DEFAULT)

NULL: means unknown or missing.

DEFAULT: uses the predefined default value of the column.


Example already shown above:

Anita ‚Üí NULL city

Vikram ‚Üí city will become 'Unknown' (default)



---

3. UPDATE with WHERE

-- Update one student‚Äôs city
UPDATE Students
SET city = 'Mumbai'
WHERE student_id = 2;

-- Update multiple rows with a condition
UPDATE Students
SET age = age + 1
WHERE city = 'Unknown';


---

4. DELETE with WHERE

-- Delete one row
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE student_id = 3;

-- Delete multiple rows with a condition
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE city IS NULL;


---

‚úÖ This covers:

1. Adding rows with INSERT INTO


2. Handling missing values (NULL and DEFAULT)


3. Updating and deleting rows safely with WHERE

Do you want me to also show you the output table after each step so it‚Äôs easier¬†to¬†visualize?
